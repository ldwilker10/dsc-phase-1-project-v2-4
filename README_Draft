## Microsoft Movie Analysis



## Project Overview

This project uses exploratory data analysis to analyze characteristics and factors of movies that are correlated to success at the box office to generate insights and recommendations for the stakeholder. Descriptive analysis of budget, gross earnings, genre and run time will be explored to see how these are related to movie success and return on investment (Measured by Net Gross Earnings). Microsoft stakeholders can use this analyis to decide what type of films to create and what budgets to plan for.


### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. I will be exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
