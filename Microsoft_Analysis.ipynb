Through exploring data from sources such as Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers, I plan to explore what types of films are doing the best at the box office and find out what characterics are correlated to movie success. These finding will be translated into actionable insights that can help Microsoft's new movie studio decide what direction to take when creating new films. "
